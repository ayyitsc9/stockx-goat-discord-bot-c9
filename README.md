StockX and Goat Discord Bot
---------------------------------

My socials :
Discord - ayyitsc9#6580
Twitter - @ayyitsc9

This is my first Github project so please take it easy on me if my code is not the best or if I did anything incorrectly ðŸ˜…

Features :
- Check Bids and Asks for a product on StockX
- Check Highest Ask for a product on Goat
- Compare payout price for a product to show which marketplace would get you a higher payout (based on Highest Ask)

Usage :
- .stockx {product_name/ sku} - Searches StockX using the parameters given (Example : .stockx yeezy 350 zebra)
- .goat {product_name/ sku} - Searches Goat using the parameters given (Example : .goat yeezy 350 cloud)
- .compare {product_name/ sku} - Searches both StockX and Goat for highest asks and compares the payout for each marketplace (Example : .compare jordan 1 bio hack)
- The compare command will prompt you for your StockX level. This is so that it uses the correct formula to determine your payout

This is a great tool for all sneaker related discord servers! Personally I have made hundreds more than I would have due to the compare command! It really makes selling easier and you can easily see where you should be listing your pair. 


Notes :
- Do not try to sell this bot as your own
- If it helps you in any way, please make sure to shout me out in your discord/ socials
- Post on my legit check on twitter https://twitter.com/ayyitsc9 and follow me!
- While I cannot help every single person right away if you need help setting the bot up, I will try my best to reply to all of them eventually!
- DM me any feature suggestions or project ideas!

Current Plans :
- Add proxy support so big servers will be able to use this without getting ip banned/ ratelimited
